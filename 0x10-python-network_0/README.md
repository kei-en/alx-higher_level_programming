# Python - Network #0

In this networking project, I used `curl` in Bash scripts to send various types of HTTP headers. In the process, I learned about how URL's work, domain names, the many different HTTP request/response header fields and status codes, and how to utilize cookies.

Task six was an algorithm challenge separate from the overall project theme completed in Python.

## Tests

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by ALX School.

## Tasks

NOTE: The `curl` behavior in all Bash scripts were written to interact with a server set up on a container provided by ALX School.

* **0. cURL body size**
  [0-body_size.sh](./0-body_size.sh): Bash script that sends a `GET` request to a given URL and displays the size of the response body in bytes.
